### Development status: Alpha. Under heavy development.

Real-time collaborative editing. Think Etherpad, but with native editors. This is the plugin for Atom. We also have plugins for [Sublime Text](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime), [Emacs](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-emacs), [Vim](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-vim), and [IntelliJ](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-intellij).

In addition to syncing text, this plugin also allows collaborators to video chat.

For a demo of this plugin in action, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liwChJKd4og) of [ggreer](https://github.com/ggreer) and [btipling](https://github.com/btipling) pairing on [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

Documentation is lacking, but you could probably get by using the Sublime Text docs.

## Configuration

A Floobits account is required.  If you don't have one, the plugin will guide you through the process.
